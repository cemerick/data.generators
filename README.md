clojure.data.generators [[FORK]]
========================================

**WIP, hasn't been published yet**

Portable Clojure/ClojureScript library for generating random data.

This is a fork of the excellent
[data.generators](https://github.com/clojure/data.generators) library, made to
be portably used from ClojureScript as well (/ht
[cljx](https://github.com/lynaghk/cljx)).  The user-facing API is exactly the
same, _except_ for the following missing bits from the ClojureScript side:

* `clojure.data.generators/ratio`
* All of the primitive `-array` generators (a TODO for the ClojureScript side
  would be to add support for generating JavaScript typed arrays, e.g.
  `Int32Array` and such)
* `clojure.data.generators/bigint` and `clojure.data.generators/bigdec`;
  investigating adding support for these in ClojureScript by producing
  [bignumbers](https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js)

This fork will track data.generators proper.  `[com.cemerick/data.generators]`
version numbers will track data.generators version numbers as well, using a
suffixed classifier (e.g. `0.1.2` turns into `0.1.2-1`) to indicate changes
here.  Eventually, it would be nice to get this work folded in upstream, but the
nuclear-bleeding edge nature of portable Clojure[Script] API development and
current toolchain restrictions of Clojure contrib mean that keeping it separate
for now makes sense.
